# ConcertAttendanceAppOriginal
The Problem: In one of my student organizations, MSC Town Hall, we put on entertainment events which consist of primarily concerts. When I first joined we took attendance metrics at these concerts by having concert-goers type their ID numbers or swipe their ID cards into an excel spreadsheet. While it worked as far as gathering the data, it wasn't very visually appealing, and looked very unproffesional. After doing some research, I took it upon myself to make a better solution.  Original App: Originally, because the computers we were using during the concerts were rather old adn had problems connecting to the campus wifi, I made an offline version of the app. I started with python because I was taking a python course at the time. Next, I settled on using the Kivy framework to produce the frontend. I got it working, where users could enter their information and the program would send it to a csv file that we could look at at the end for our metrics.
